`public interface Iterator<E>`

An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections Framework. Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways:

* Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
* Method names have been improved. 

>This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
